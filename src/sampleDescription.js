const sampleDescription = `The Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, was originally founded in 1897 as the Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration by granddaughters of industrialist Peter Cooper. It was inspired by the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and was established to provide resources for designers and students. Initially located within the Cooper Union's Foundation Building, it was the only museum in the U.S. dedicated exclusively to design.

The museum experienced significant growth under its directors, notably Amelia Earhart Hare, who played a pivotal role in its expansion during the 1930s and beyond. Despite challenges and threats of closure in the 1960s, it was eventually taken over by the Smithsonian Institution in 1967. Following the transfer, the museum moved to the Andrew Carnegie Mansion on the Upper East Side, significantly increasing its exhibition space.

Under Smithsonian auspices, the museum underwent several name changes, reflecting its expanding mission from focusing on decorative arts to a broader design perspective. This included a significant renovation and rebranding effort in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, enhancing its educational programs and public engagement.

The museum continued to evolve with technological advancements and design trends, aiming to bridge traditional design disciplines with innovation and modernity. It faced leadership changes and continued efforts for expansion and increased public interaction through digital initiatives and educational outreach.

Despite a brief closure for renovation, the museum reopened with enhanced exhibition spaces and interactive features, solidifying its stance as a prominent institution dedicated to contemporary design and its impact on daily life, accommodating a wide range of public programs and digital engagement strategies.`;
